The Extract step covers the data extraction from the source system and makes it accessible for further processing.
The main objective of the extract step is to retrieve all the required data from the source system with as little resources as possible.
The extract step should be designed in a way that it does not negatively affect the source system in terms or performance, response time or any kind of locking.
